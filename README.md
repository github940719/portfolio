This repository serves as my portfolio for the Shopee 2025 Apprentice Program, and it includes:
1. My English certificates:
   - GEPT High Intermediate Level
   - TOEIC Golden Certificate
   - EMI online course
2. My data analysis portfolio, which was developed during the Macro Programming and Data Analytics course:
  - Project 1: Analyze passenger data of the Taipei Metro using Excel VBA.
               Note that the original Excel file (.xlsm) is too large to put onto the repository.
  - Project 2: Analyze passenger data of Youbike in Taipei City using Python, particularly Pandas and Matplotlib.
  - Project 3: Downloade traffic flow data from the Freeway Bureau (MOTC) using Python (requests and gzip) and perform analysis on VD and CMS data.
